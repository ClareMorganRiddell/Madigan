					<span>Maddie is turning 2 Saturday the 17th of June!</span>
				<br>
					Can you come out to play? We’ll have food and games for the little ones, and a little area 
					for the grownups to play too. Everyone is welcome to dress up to make things extra fun and silly;
					especially the grownups!
				</p>
				<p> 
					Maddie loves her some <span>Peppa Pig</span>, so this cute little piggy will be featured heavily in the party decorations. If you don’t know her yet, check her out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FW_jgdT3ryQ">here</a>.

						Kiddies are welcome from <span>10:00</span>, and will probably be beat by about 12:30. There’ll be space to play inside and outside, and a nice seat for the grownups to relax on.
					</p>
					<p>
						Grownup friends <i>(which actually Mommy and Daddy’s friends also)</i> are welcome from the afternoon around <span>16:00</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Maddie has 4 pets, but only 2 of them (little stripy cats) will be home. They are friendly but they prefer they are not really into playing with kids so they’ll stay out of reach of the kiddies.
